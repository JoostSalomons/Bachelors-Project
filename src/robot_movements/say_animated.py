"""
Description:
    This module defines the say_animated function, which simulates an animated
    speech and gesture sequence for a robot. The robot will speak the provided
    text and perform gestures based on the content of the text. It utilizes
    predefined gesture generators and performs movement synchronously with the
    speech output. The sequence ensures that the gestures are appropriately
    timed with the spoken text, providing a more natural animation.
